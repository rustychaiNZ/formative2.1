# Foundation Coding
### Formative 1

The code in this repository is broken.  
Your task is to try and fix it.

You shouldn't need to add any new code but rather edit what is already there, though there might be some exceptions.

Fork this repo, then clone the forked project to your computer and try to solve it.  
Once you think you have solved it, push it back up to git and then send a link to your repository to your tutor who will check to see if you have solved it.

If you successfully solve it, well done.  
If you don't then keep trying to figure out what is wrong with it and try again.
